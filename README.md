# Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS)

## Project Overview
Developed as part of the EDOS task, this project implements an end-to-end NLP pipeline to detect and categorize sexist content in social media datasets. The focus was on creating a transparent and explainable model that can navigate linguistic nuances.

## Features
* **Full ETL Pipeline:** Designed a robust Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to consolidate unstructured social media data into structured formats for model training.
* **Comparative Modeling:** Built and benchmarked multiple architectures, including **SVM, SGD, and Transformer-based models**.
* **Interpretability:** Focused on "explainability" by conducting detailed evaluations using confusion matrices to interpret model behavior across different categories of sexism.

## Engineering & Collaboration
* **Version Control:** Managed the project using **Git/GitHub**, following Agile-aligned workflows including modular code structures and pull requests.
* **Data Auditing:** Performed rigorous data audits to identify labeling ambiguities, ensuring high process reproducibility and transparency.

## Technologies Used
* **Languages:** Python
* **Libraries:** PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, HuggingFace Transformers
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git
